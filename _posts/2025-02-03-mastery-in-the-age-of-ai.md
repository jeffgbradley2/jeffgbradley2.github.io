Sometime in the last few months, AI coding agents arrived at the ability to write better Python than I do.

To be fair, until relatively recently, Java and Typescript were my daily driver languages. But over the last year, Python has become number one.

During that same time, Claude Code burst onto the scene, and in the last few months, with updates to the agentic harness and Opus 4.5, it has largely surpassed my ability in coding Python.

And still, over the last few months, I have consumed multiple large volumes of Python books, including Python in a Nutshell and Fluent Python, and more recently, Effective Python. I take notes, create and study Anki flashcards (of which I have over a thousand in my Python deck), and have Claude quiz me every day and give me exercises. Every week, I review all my notes, and I practice spaced repetition.

What is the point of this? Is this not all wasted time, in the age of AI, where human coding is fast becoming legacy?

The answer is that _mastery in and of itself is a reward_, and the pursuit of mastery is a fulfilling one. I _enjoy_ waking early and reading a great technical book with my morning coffee, jotting down by hand the things that I want to know and add to my practice. This, and the slow but steady progress I make, are like a slow-release dopamine pill I take daily that builds in my system.

Not to mention that just because we have tools that generate code for us on command does not mean that we shouldn't understand and be able to produce that code ourselves. In fact, it may be more important now than ever! As an example, it wasn't long ago that Claude Code made such a mess of the async pipeline in an evaluation framework I wrote that I had to rewrite much of it by hand. How would I have done that without the work I've put in to build fluency in Python?

The fact that these tools are now, and probably forevermore will be better at coding than I am does _not_ mean that mastery is no longer required, or that the pursuit of mastery is no longer worth our time. It is great to vibe our way to productivity which was previously beyond our reach. But we should not sell ourselves short, or buy so much into the hype that we lose out on the joy of mastery.
