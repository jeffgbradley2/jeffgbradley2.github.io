Over the last few years, I've used Large Language Models at work and in my personal life, like most people in the industrialized world. LLMs amaze me with their ability to understand and produce coherent, useful text. But I'm also regularly let down by them, sometimes in unexpected and subtle ways. Small changes to inputs can produce drastically different outputs. I've spent many hours evaluating LLMs and building evaluation frameworks, all with the goal of creating AI systems that are consistently trustworthy. 

It's hard! At the end of the day, it often remains frustratingly qualitative. As I've gone deeper into data science and machine learning, I've started thinking about this problem differently. What if we could go beyond qualitative measures and off-the-shelf evaluation frameworks? What if we could bring classical probability and statistics, math that has stood the test of time, to bear on this problem, combined with modern NLP techniques?

What might that look like? How would it be built?

## Introducing MetaReason

I think I have a vision for it, and so I've started a company named [MetaReason](https://github.com/metareason-ai) whose sole mission is to apply classic probability and statistics, combined with modern NLP, to the problem of quantifying confidence in LLMs.

I chose the name because this is space inherently meta, using models to evaluate models, while "meta" also captures the nature of probability and statistics itself. And we're fully in the uncanny valley of machines that can reason. Yes, I know it's "just" simulated reasoning, but so what? If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... 

So MetaReason is a kind of way to reason about reasoning, so to speak. A method to evaluate ones intelligence.

## Open Source, Open Governance 

I'm also becoming something of a battle-hardened [AI Governance](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-governance) practitioner. My experience has taught me that governance matters, but only when it's genuinely beneficial, not just box-checking. And it should be open for all to see.

So MetaReason is an Open Source, Open Governance company, built to evaluate and improve the very thing on which its foundations rest. Something different.

I wonder what that might look like? What could it become?

Let's find out.
