Risk management in an enterprise environment is a significant undertaking, but it's a necessary one. It's often downplayed by fast-moving teams as something that "slows you down" and "adds bureaucracy." Perhaps those teams haven't yet had to deal with the consequences of an unmitigated risk, or they simply prioritize speed above all else.

I've found that AI risk management is even more complex than its traditional counterpart. There are many unique factors to consider that fall outside the typical scope, such as prompt injection, data poisoning, model misalignment, and rogue agents, the list goes on. At the same time, AI is advancing and being deployed at a rate I haven't seen in my career. It seems every company is racing to implement LLMs and intelligent agents.

### The NIST AI Risk Management Framework
Fortunately, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a comprehensive [AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) that is free to use. It's not a light read, but it is exceptionally thorough. For the interested reader, I suggest loading the PDF into a tool like NotebookLM to help you digest it (NotebookLM is a fantastic tool for this, by the way).

The framework outlines four core functions for AI risk management: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage. Let's explore what these mean in practice.

#### Govern
AI Governance is a topic in and of itself. It involves building a culture that understands and values the process of managing risk. This is no easy task; in my experience, changing or building a culture is the most challenging part of implementing any management system. However, this cultural foundation is a crucial first step. It lays the groundwork for developing the policies and procedures that support the entire risk management process, such as a formal Risk Management Policy and a Risk Assessment and Mitigation Process.

#### Map
Writing a procedure doesn't mean the job is done. Now comes the hard part: implementing and maintaining the process. To use some terminology from the ISO world, this is where we "establish the context" of the organization. We identify stakeholders and analyze how they might be affected by the AI system. This context provides the foundation for identifying and categorizing risks and their sources. It allows us to weigh the potential positive and negative impacts and anticipate what could go wrong.

#### Measure
With governance in place and risks mapped, it's time to assess and monitor them. The assessment process typically analyzes the likelihood and impact of each risk, often on a scale of 1 to 5, to determine an overall risk level. This level then dictates the required action, such as Mitigate, Accept, or Avoid. If mitigation is the chosen path, specific controls are selected and implemented. The system is then monitored with these controls in place to determine the residual risk.

#### Manage
Managing risks involves allocating resources, assigning responsibilities, and documenting risk treatment plans. When implementing a framework like [ISO 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001), this means planning who is responsible for what, carrying out the risk treatment process, and documenting the results. It also involves communicating these plans and outcomes to stakeholders and establishing a schedule for regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

### Benefits of AI Risk Management
Like insurance or a firewall, the value of time and money spent on AI risk management isn't always felt directly. Instead, the benefit is the absence of a negative event. The old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is especially true here. A nickel spent on upfront planning and mitigation can save a dollar (or a million) down the road. And when done properly, this process can uncover opportunities that might have otherwise been missed.

At my day job, risk management is welded into our AI system development lifecycle. When we identify a new use case, we immediately initiate a problem definition and impact assessment. This allows us to identify potential negative impacts from the outset. We then conduct a formal risk assessment, log the risks in a register, and determine if they are acceptable. If a risk is unacceptable, we establish a treatment plan and implement the necessary controls.

This mitigation process can be specific to a single system or applied more broadly to all systems. It also addresses risks associated with the AI tools we use internally, such as over-reliance on coding assistants or potential data leakage. These steps move us toward a system of operating where we can safely develop, deploy, and use AI to benefit ourselves, our organization, and our customers.
