Sometimes frameworks like ISO 42001 are a drag. It can seem like all you do is check boxes for compliance, without adding any real value. This is the pit of despair for any management system. 

I'm deep in that pit right now. Having just finished implementing an AI Management System, I'm now working on dotting the I's and crossing the T's as I prepare for an audit. Much of that work is frustratingly irrelevant to actually implementing safe, robust AI systems. Answering questions like "why does this document not reference the other document" feels like compliance theater, just to get the stamp of certification.

That annoys me to no end because it's important to me to do AI governance right and not just check off boxes for compliance sake. I know these things are beneficial when done right, with minimal bureaucracy and ceremony. But it's easier to just add meaningless policies and procedures that no one will ever read but that satisfy some compliance check box. Implementing a valuable governance system is much harder.

## Focusing on Value Over Checkboxes 

So how to do that without getting bogged down in BS? In times like these its important to double down on the act of governing, not the compliance checklists. So I'm taking a big picture view, looking at the system as a whole, and asking "Where can I reduce overhead and ceremony? Where is the most value?"

## Building Culture, Not Just Systems

I think this is really important, not just for the sake of a successful and value-add AI Management System, but for the sake of organizational culture as well. If everyone at the company thinks "This is all compliance theater BS and a waste of time and money" then the system is bound to fail eventually. People have to SEE the value for themselves, feel it, and not just be told.

## Pushing Back on Auditors 

I'm also a big believer in pushing back on auditors. I love that, actually. While it isn't always the best move, pushing back on meaningless documentation is necessary sometimes, as long as you can show evidence that you are doing what you say you do and what the standard requires. Pointing to real results is more valuable than pulling out some dusty document no one has read.
