Let's get this out of the way upfront: I use the absolute hell out of LLMs. I use them every single day, for work, for study, for research. And I use (or have used) all of the big players: Claude, Gemini, Llama, and of course, ChatGPT.

I'm the reason climate change is accelerating. It's me.

After years of using these things and evolving alongside them, my approach has become more refined. I've moved past the initial hype and developed a specialist's toolkit. I am, without a doubt, an LLM power user. This is what I've learned, focusing on how I use them for maximum productivity.

## The Golden Days of ChatGPT

Ah, those were the days. Amazement. Thrill. Existential dread. The sky was the limit.

GPT-4 was an absolute breakthrough for me. As a full-time software engineer, I felt my world expanding and caving in at the same time. I began using ChatGPT for writing documentation, comments, and even code. I jumped on the Github Copilot bandwagon, and although it was really just super autocomplete, I was impressed. How couldn't you be impressed to see the code appear before you even considered what to write? Black Magic!

At that time, Gemini was a joke and Claude wasn't a real contender, so ChatGPT was the only game in my town. I was definitely an early adopter, for better or worse, and began to look for as many ways I could to optimize my processes. I experimented with Cursor to see what all the hype was about, and shortly thereafter, quit Copilot for good.

## Claude Has Entered the Chat

Claude became a serious contender at version 3.0, and it was clear that, for coding, the Anthropic team was onto something. It had that special sauce, and while it still wasn't quite up to the GPT-4 level of (simulated) intelligence, it was still good.

With 3.5, Claude became my daily driver, and I marvelled as Anthropic kept shipping innovation after innovation: artifacts, MCPs, and Claude Code, just to name a few. Having been a user of Copilot and Cursor, I was familiar with AI coding tools, but something was different about Claude Code. It was clearly built for the power user and specialized in tool use. I started using Claude Code for almost all daily coding and documentation. It felt like a superpower.

## Google Wakes Up

Gemini caught up to the pack at 2.0, and Google released NotebookLM, an absolutely amazing research tool. I started loading every research paper into NotebookLM, interacting with it, asking questions, and creating podcasts. It was and still is incredible.

And Gemini kept improving. While all the other LLM providers whine about data, the Google team seems to be happily cooking. Probably because they have a detailed data stream on half of the people in the world. They are not hurting for data.

But I still didn't find a good daily use for Gemini, not like ChatGPT or Claude.

##  My Specialist Toolkit

Currently, Claude is on version 4.1, Gemini is 2.5, and ChatGPT is on GPT-5 (although OpenAI's models are going through a crisis). But I have found specialized use cases for each and am in a pretty comfortable routine.

Claude is my go-to, number one guy for all coding and engineering-related work. Claude Code is an incredible tool, now with sub-agents and model selectors. I regularly have four terminal windows with Claude Code firing away, each one spinning up sub-agents that are specialized in specific tasks, like refactoring or architecture or technical documentation. It is a true superpower.

Gemini is my go-to for search, research, and learning. Its study mode is pretty damn good, and its ability to create flashcard and quiz applications right there in the chat interface is very useful to me. I like to take a paper or PDF, load it into NotebookLM, create a study guide and mind map, and then load that into Gemini to tutor and quiz me. It is a fantastic way to learn and study.

ChatGPT is... well, still ChatGPT. I use it very little anymore, but when I do, it is more for an interactive journal. But I've kind of grown out of ChatGPT and find I have less and less use for it.

## Automating Compliance

Building an AI Management System and getting ISO 42001 certified, I've used both Claude and Gemini to help draft policies and procedures and to help automate the grunt work of compliance. Having built ISO-certified management systems in the past, I can tell you that these LLMs are power tools for generating the many documents and records required by auditors and regulatory bodies. It has been so nice.

Unlike most writing (like this blog), with compliance documents, it's fine to use an LLM to generate the first drafts. Policies, procedures, forms, instructions, and diagrams are technical and don't require personal touch or creativity. They are also often just for records, proof that you planned something or did something. This is the perfect example of avoiding 'compliance theater.' By using LLMs to handle the first drafts of tedious but necessary documentation, I can focus my energy on the actual governance and strategic thinking, which must remain an all-human task.

## Downsides

It's important to note that I do worry and actively try to combat the natural atrophy of my skills. I have felt the pull of using these tools more and more, and know that there is real danger in becoming nothing more than a prompter, someone that delegates all thinking to LLMs. So I spend my free time studying, learning, coding, working exercises and challenges, and writing. I like puzzles and games, and I like to think. But I know many people won't devote that time, especially young people, and I don't kid myself that there is still some negative impact occurring, some technical debt of the mind. That's what happens when you delegate.

So here is where I make my responsible AI pitch as it applies to my own use, and anyone else's personal use. We have to be responsible with our usage of these tools, just like our usage of phones or social media. Each of us is different, and I don't blame anyone for avoiding LLMs entirely. But in my profession, and in the business world, I just don't think it is going to be an option much longer. So we might as well come to grips with that and figure out how we can use these things in a way that benefits us and doesn't just turn us into mindless zombies.

## Build a System, Not a Habit

My journey with LLMs has taught me one thing: we have to be responsible and intentional. Blindly using a single tool for everything is a recipe for mediocrity and mental atrophy. The real power comes from building a personal system where each tool has a specific job. And where I don't delegate critical thinking or creativity, my soul, so to speak.

In my profession, avoiding these tools isn't a viable option in the long-term. The key is to engage with them critically, understand their weaknesses, and build a workflow that amplifies my own intelligence, rather than replacing it. That is the essence of being a true power user.
