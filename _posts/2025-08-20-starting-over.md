Last night I did something a little crazy. I deleted the entire MetaReason Core codebase. 

Why in the hell would I do that? It was over twenty thousand lines of code!

I deleted it because I realized that I was working under a misconception which I believe was doing a profound disservice to myself. See, I started out thinking I needed (had to) rush, go fast, so that I would have something as soon as possible. As I moved fast, I did what everyone is doing these days: I used coding agents. 

Don't get me wrong, Claude Code and its ilk are great at writing code. Sometimes. In very controlled, very narrow tasks. Or just scripts.

But I, in my haste, was moving fast and relying on coding agents for a lot of heavy lifting. Sure, I reviewed the code and understood it at a high level, but I wasn't _writing it_, I wasn't struggling with it myself. 

There is a principle in learning that the less you struggle, the less you learn. The easier it comes, the faster it goes. And so here I was, generating thousands of lines of code at the speed of Claude Code, but what was I accomplishing for myself? Was I really using it to my advantage?

Perhaps if coding agents were more advanced and it _really_ wasn't necessary to still be a master of your code, then sure. In that universe, I wouldn't have been doing myself a disservice. But in the real world, where agents are still far away from total ownership of codebases (in spite of what all the hype cycle tell us), offloading that cognitive effort is a mistake. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

It certainly isn't a good idea to offload opportunities for learning. And ultimately, the surest win that MetaReason provides to me is the process of _doing_, of _struggling_, of _learning_. It won't happen overnight, not if I don't sweat and cuss and fight my way through every line, every character. It certainly won't happen if I outsource it all to AI.

There is still a place for ol' Claude Code. I've set explicit instructions for it to work in advisory mode and not to change the code unless explicitly ordered to do so, and set it to the new "Explanation" output style by default. I'll still use it to write some comments for my code, and I'm thankful to have it to review my code, to be my rubber ducky. And it is still absolute fire at the command line, no doubt about that, and shell scripts, yeah that too.

But for crafting Python code, for writing good documentation, for working through the algorithms and struggling with the code, that's between me and the keyboard. Claude Code can help, sure, but it can't replace. It can't sweat so I have to. How else will I learn? And what good will it be if I don't even do that?
