title: Optimize the Optimizer
categories: [featured]
---

We spend so much time optimizing code, systems, processes. Lately I took a step back and spent some time optimizing the optimizer, so to speak. Myself.

It's been nice, and I've certainly found a sweet spot. I want to share it because I think it is overlooked how much of a compounding gains, like a small but consistent return on a financial investment, can be. But unlike long-term financial investments, the dividends from self-optimization start paying off almost immediately, creating a powerful feedback loop. Hereâ€™s the system I built for myself.

## Why Optimize

I spent the last month spending every minute I could muster of my free time on development of MetaReason and studying Bayesian modeling. But its hard to wake up and study every morning, work all day, then go _back_ to work until late into the night. It's hard to not just stay motivated, but stay cogent, honestly. And burn out is a thing.

So, before I started, I decided to take steps and follow through for the duration. And while everyone implicitly knows these things, I think it is still worth saying, because the cumulative impact has been significant on my mental wellbeing, productivity, and learning, all of which are (and should be) important to long-term happiness and success.

So here goes.

## Optimize Your Tools

I knew that I would be doing some "heavy" work with MetaReason, running local LLMs, massive Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, and that I would be spending A LOT of time on my computer, keyboard, and mouse. So I made a significant financial investment in a machine that can do all I need at the speed I need it. It was a _huge_ investment, financially, but it has proven to be well worth it so far and I know I will get many years of high-quality use out of it. And, while not everyone can afford such a purchase, the principle is universal: get the right tool for the job, or upgrade your current tools, to the absolute limit. Investing in your tools always pays off. 

I also bought my first mechanical keyboard, a Keychron Q3 Max, with Gateron Jupiter Red switches, and configured it to a specific lighting schema when I type. I found that the tactile feel and the light add a whole new dimension to typing, especially at night when I'm working late. I absolutely love it.

I also bought a Logitech ergonomic mouse to replace the run-of-the-mill mouse. Nothing flashy there, but the ergonomics are a long-term payoff. 

## Optimize Your Space

Talking to my fellow developers, it seems like few put a lot of thought into their home work spaces. I get that not everyone spends their after-hours working and studying like I do, and not everyone has the luxury of their own space or home office. But I spent a lot of time and money over the years on mine, and it has paid off. 

I've invested in soft, warm, dimmable lighting, which goes so far to making a cozy environment I love coming back to. And I've purchased a nice chair with a special cushion for support which makes sitting for long periods a breeze. And I've spent time finding just the right scent for my room. And much more.

All these minor adjustments and improvements to my home office have left me with something that is truly special to me, a cozy place I love to come to, no matter what time of day or night, and sit down at my desk. I can't recommend optimizing your work space for your own taste enough.

## Optimize Your Body

I would be remiss not to advise exercise here. Exercise has been a major part of my life since I was a teenager, so it's easy for me to talk about. But I've recently been injured (or lazy) and haven't exercised like in my younger years. And I've noticed a decline in how my body feels: more pain, less stamina, and more fat. 

But over this month I got back to work in my garage, pumping iron and riding the bike that doesn't go anywhere. It was _brutal_ at first and I realized how out of shape I was. But now, a month in, and I'm back to doing high intensity interval training, going all out, and feeling _good_ afterwards. I mean, really good. 

And I've noticed I can remember things and think clearer, now that I am exercising. We know that one of the few things proven to improve the brain is exercise; it's a fact. So its worth spending 20-30 minutes 5 or 6 times a week working up a sweat. Remember, compounding gains. 

## Optimize Your Learning

Many people I know go about learning like this: they read a book or a blog or watch some videos. Done.

That's not learning! At least, not in a topic that requires you to actually _apply_ what you have learned. There is a saying that if you don't struggle, you don't learn. I have found that to be true.

This is where AI enters the chat (pun intended). The _best_ use case for these modern chat bots I have found is for learning support. I have found a super sweet spot that apparently no one else is doing, which has absolutely optimized my learning to a point far beyond where it was before. 

First, I use the SQ3RTR method, adapted from the SQ3R method, which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review. I added Test and Repeat to that. And yes, I realize it can be pronounced "squirter." It's a bonus.

So now, I follow that technique as I have in the past, surveying what I will be studying, making notes and questions on flash cards, then actively read, reciting and explaining each section to myself as I read it, and then review what I've read, writing things down. 

Here is where AI helps out. I'll convert my hand-written notes into a study guide using one of the LLMs, and from that, I'll generate quizzes and exercises. I've got a dedicated project (in Claude) with specific instructions which primes the LLM to act as my tutor, and I swear it is the best tutor I've ever had (easy since it's the only tutor lol). But the _process_ of actively reading, reciting, reviewing, then going to my tutor to test me and give me exercises, has been rocket fuel for my learning, and importantly, my ability to _actually do_ the things I'm learning.

## Optimize Your Intake

Finally, I cut out alcohol completely and ensured that I was getting plenty of water, protein, and vitamins with a healthy diet. I'm lucky and can afford a local meal prep service near my house (which is actually quite cheap compared to the average restaurant), and that helps me easily get the healthy "macros" I need. And if a service isn't an option, dedicating a few hours on a Sunday to meal prep can achieve the same goal: making healthy choices the path of least resistance during a busy week.

But I supplement that with a health shake in the morning that includes whey protein and creatine, two supplements that have been studied for damn near a hundred years, and which are proven not just to be safe (given the manufacturer isn't dousing them in heavy metals, shop wisely!), but also proven to be beneficial for your brain. Creatine, in particular, is needed for energy and brain activity, and studies show that, although it doesn't make you smarter, it can help feed your brain with the fuel it needs to be sharp.

## Optimize Your People

I'm an introvert, and I don't engage with any social media platforms. None. So I miss out on a lot of things.

But I've made it a priority to maintain a healthy friendships, and to talk and visit with family as often as I can.

Maintaining relationships is hard. As a dude, with my friends being other dudes, it's normal to not speak to each other. That's how we are. But I make an effort to text and call my friends regularly, just to say hi and check in, see if they are doing ok. And I physically visit with a few friends every week. It can be hard because it usually seems like I'm the one always reaching out, and it often is the case. But that's just how we dudes are (women probably are the same), and I've found that building the habit to simply text or call people, and regularly visit with friends and family, is like a kind of super power. But it isn't easy to maintain. 

However, it is worth it. And studies show that one of the best things we can do for our mental health and wellbeing and our brain health is maintain lots of _real_ friendships. It's important.

## Optimize Your Partner

Last but most certainly not least is optimizing my closest relationship: my wife. This is pretty easy, but I think it's important to put a great deal of focus here, since your partner is your partner. I commit to listening to something important or problematic that she is going through _every day_, and if she doesn't offer something, I ask her things until I find something to listen about. And I _really_ listen. And I eat a meal with her every day, and kiss her every day, and make her laugh every day. I can pass up on everything else in this list but that. It is non-negotiable. 

## So What

So what? Aren't these all minor things? Maybe only for someone privileged like myself? Maybe. 

But I feel like these little things add up, and I think that, based on my sample size, most tech workers have the same privilege. And I also think most people don't give much heed to these things, or at least don't prioritize optimizing them all, with an eye to the compounding gains they provide in the long term. But they should. You should. I do, and it makes all the difference.
