# Pseudo Productive

A few years ago, I read "Deep Work" by Cal Newport. In it, Newport introduced me to the concept of "pseudo-work," a plague on modern knowledge workers. I recently started his newer book, "Slow Productivity," where he expands on this with the idea of "pseudo-productivity."

These terms resonate with me. Having been a knowledge worker for most of my adult life, I can attest that much of our time, and for some people, their entire jobs, is spent on pseudo-work, all while appearing to be pseudo-productive.

## What is Pseudo-Work?

Pseudo-work is essentially busy work. Based on my experience, it's a common malady. I have known (and still know!) many project managers, account managers, and marketing directors who are always so busy. Their calendars are filled with meetings, their inboxes are overflowing, and their Slack channels are constantly buzzing. But are they actually moving the needle forward? Are they doing anything meaningful for the team or the organization? Often, the answer is no.

Newport argues that this arises from the nature of knowledge work, where it's easier to display the artifacts of work, like emails, memos, and instant messages, than the work itself. This focus on visible activity over actual accomplishment, fueled by too much chatter and social media, creates a culture of pseudo-productivity.

I love his observation that "talking about work, as fast and frantically as possible" is a key indicator. This is gold. I have been in countless stand-ups where people do just that, rattling off a list of activities with no substance. For example: "We've got lots and lots of meetings and so much going on, all the things... like so-and-so said, I'm working on supporting all the initiatives and meeting with everyone..." It's ridiculous.

## The "Always On" Culture

The constantly connected culture of today's office is a major contributor, according to Newport. I get it. He points to open floor plans, Slack, email, and social media as productivity killers. To that, I say: "Hell, yes, they are!" While some roles thrive on constant connectivity, they are few and far between compared to the ones I've seen get lost in those tools.

At the risk of sounding like an old man, I'll admit that I'm not on social media (other than the obligatory LinkedIn). I never got into it, and I'm glad. Things are distracting enough without Instagram and TikTok dragging my attention away from what needs to be done. I don't need more bad habits; I need more good ones.

## The Grey Lines

I'm not without fault. I'm sure there have been times when I've used technology to appear more productive than I was. So let me be humble and admit that.

But I am, and have always been, an individual contributor where the stakes and responsibility are high. I'm known for being highly productive, so I hate it when I see any sign of pseudo-productivity in myself.

That said, some tasks that might be considered pseudo-work, like compliance training, are simply required. I hate compliance theater more than anyone, but some things aren't optional. That doesn't mean we can't work to strip the pseudo-work out of these required tasks and increase their value. Any organization should strive to make its processes as valuable as possible, automate what can be automated, and eliminate anything that is neither valuable nor required.

## Pseudo-Consequences

A reliance on this type of fake work leads to burnout, according to Newport. That makes perfect sense. If you're always spinning your wheels as more and more piles on, without ever accomplishing anything of value, it's a recipe for feeling overwhelmed.

It also undermines genuine achievement. By "flooding the zone" with the artifacts of busyness, pseudo-productivity distracts from the real accomplishments of those who actually move the needle and deserve recognition.

Finally, Newport notes there is a tax, like tech debt, that accumulates as more time is spent managing this increasing load of busywork. As commitments pile up, workloads increase, and real productivity declines.

## Slow Down and Work Deeply

The answer, according to Newport, is to slow down, remove distractions, and work deeply. That conclusion isn't surprising, but I've found that implementing it is incredibly hard. I've tried time-blocking my days, with hours allotted for focused work where all devices are in "Do Not Disturb" mode and Slack is turned off. I've even kept this up for months at a time.

But it's not always possible to keep distractions at bay, particularly in an open floor plan or an open-door culture with subordinates who need guidance. And there will always be required tasks that feel like busy work.

Even so, it's worth the effort. I recently jumped back on the Deep Work bandwagon and I'm making a concerted effort to slow down, focusing less on just "getting things done" and more on the value of my work and the quality of my output. It's a constant battle, with dozens of Jira epics staring me in the face and new "opportunities" always around the corner. But hey, we have to try, right?

And in those spans of time where I have been able to consistently apply deep, slow work, like late at night or when I've worked remotely without direct reports, it truly has been a game changer for both my productivity and my mental health.
