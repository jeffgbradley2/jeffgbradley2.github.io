title: The Death of Charlie Kirk
---

I learned of the man named Charlie Kirk today. Charlie was a famous friend of famous men.

He was shot dead at the Utah Valley this afternoon, **violence** on his tongue.

## Annunciation

Children were shot in church a few weeks ago. Bullets through glass windows. 

I wonder at the beautiful creatures they must have been.

## Where all the good people at?

I once knew a good man. He was kind and true. He led me through the valley and I mourned his passing.

Was Charlie good? The witnesses? The killer? 

Am I?

What is good in this world?

## Charlie Kirk is Dead

Charlie Kirk died today, shot dead, violence on his last breath. 

Violence and death.
