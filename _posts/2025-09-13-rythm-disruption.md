title: One Night Out Wrecked My Good Habits
---

Over the last couple months I've gotten into a nice rhythm of waking early, studying, exercising, working, then studying or working on side projects into the evening, all while maintaining relationships. I've been really happy, because I'm the type of person for whom a disciplined schedule where I make progress in life goals while living simply each day is happiness. 

While I'm the type of person that relishes this type of lifestyle, I find it can be disrupted pretty easily. This last week, celebrating a company milestone, many of us that were there at the start of the company were wined and dined by our CEO, treated to a phenomenal night out, an absolute treat. We laughed, we ate, we drank. We had a great time. 

## Consequences

Unfortunately, for someone that doesn't drink much and who is usually asleep by 11 pm, staying out late merrymaking takes a toll. The next day I felt quite awful, with a terrible headache and upset stomach. I woke hours past my normal 5 am, didn't exercise or study, and although I worked, I wasn't very productive. I went to sleep right after an early dinner. 

But the evil hangover wasn't the worst of it. 

The following day, a Friday, now a full day removed from the hell of the hangover, I also slept in a little, still recovering apparently, and didn't work out or study in the morning. After work, I again comforted myself with a big meal and watched TV, then to bed early. Another day of no exercise, no study, and no work on side projects, comforting myself with food and sleep. 

During this timeframe I've noticed that my thinking was also not as sharp. Kind of a lingering brain fog. Not just the day after either, but into the second and third day. Even today, day four, I feel like my mind is a little foggy. 

The alcohol and loss of sleep and disruption to my healthy lifestyle really hit my mind hard.

## Destabilized

As the days have progressed, I continue to find it hard to get back into full rhythm. This is really surprising to me, since I had fully established the habits. I'd reached a point where I enjoyed waking early, grabbing a coffee and hitting the books, walking the dog, exercising, and taking a cold shower. And I'd grown to love coming to my home office in the evening after work, studying more or working on a side project. 

In my experience, good habits are lost far faster than they are gained. This is a cruel reality, particularly if the habit wasn't instilled in you at a young age or you haven't practiced it for a very long time. Even then, they seem so brittle sometimes.

I myself have been an early riser for decades, and worked out mornings my entire adult life, so for me these really are long-term habits. Even so, alcohol and the surrounding events were enough to destabilize my rhythm and leave me days in the hole of lost productivity. It's as if a single break in my habit chain, caused by over consumption and accompanied by a hangover, gave my brain permission to be lazy "until further notice."

## Reset

I'm not taking this sitting down. Enough is enough! This morning (Sunday), I woke at my usual 5 am, got coffee, and went to my office for some light study, a review of all I've studied the previous week, like normal. That was enough to start the habit chain, and I followed it by taking my dog for a nice long walk before going to see my mom. After dinner, I reminded myself how cozy my office is and how nice it would feel to write a blog and a little code with some good music, and here I am. 

Tomorrow, I'm going to add back the morning exercise and cold shower, and in the evening, I'll get back to work on MetaReason or some other side project or new topic to learn. I'm actively looking forward to that, how it will feel to be back to my sharp, productive, bookish self. 

And I'm going to remember this, just how destabilizing it was to drink a little too much and stay out a little too late. It's worth it sometimes, in some situations, to share special moments with friends and family. But there are consequences. And they really can get your good habits right off track. 

Back to work!
