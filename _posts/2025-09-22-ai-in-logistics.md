title: AI Agents, Spreadsheets, and Logistics
---

I've worked as a software engineer in the logistics industry for a long time, over 17 years. It feels like my whole career, really.

AI has thrown a new wrinkle into this fast-moving industry. Lately, some of our customers and partners, 3PLs and shippers, have been kind enough (or demanding enough!) to share the opportunities they see for AI optimizations within their processes. It has been fascinating.

## Standards are Lame

There are so many standards in logistics for communicating electronically. The first EDI standard was published for the transportation industry in 1975, for god's sake.

And yet, somehow all these companies have managed to avoid true standardization. There is still no unified standard for an Order API, for instance, and I'm sure it will only happen after we are all long dead.

This lack of standardization in communication protocols and data schemas is why enterprise integration is such a huge deal in logistics. In all my years, across all the companies I've worked for, I have never seen a new client onboarded without significant integration engineering. To this day, it remains a major undertaking.

## Spreadsheets are Still King

First and foremost, logistics professionals still work mainly in Excel. Spreadsheets are the lingua franca of logistics, and that doesn't appear to be changing any time soon, even after decades of tech companies trying to lure them away.

This makes a lot of sense: spreadsheets are cheap, ubiquitous, and feature-rich. You can run an entire business on spreadsheets and email, and many have done just that. The universality of the venerable spreadsheet is truly impressive.

## Where's My Shipment?

An enormous amount of time and money is spent by logistics professionals on low-value, time-consuming, mind-numbing responses to clients asking about the status of their shipment.

Some of our clients, the ones that handle logistics for their clients, report spending hundreds of person-hours monthly just responding to these status requests. Hundreds! For each request, they have to find the shipment in their system (or spreadsheet), call the carrier or go to the carrier's website, find the shipment again, and email back the status.

We have sent robots to Mars and wield powerful AI at our fingertips, and here we are, calling each other up to ask, "Where's my shipment?!"

## It's Not Rocket Science

These tasks, which customers report as being so high-cost, are also the lowest-skill. Just last week, a customer told us they are paying tens of thousands of dollars a month for work that can be done "by anyone off the street within a week, no experience or education required."

That is wild to me. Needless to say, all of our customers and nearly every company in logistics is looking to automate this drudgery with AI.

## Agents to the Rescue

In almost all of these cases, the answer isn't "come onto our platform" anymore. That was the old way.

The new solution is brand new and just getting off its training wheels: AI Agents. Or, more specifically, Agent Swarms.

These agent swarms, known to almost every business user I talk to (even those who know nothing of deep tech), are now capable of automating low-skill, repetitive computer-driven tasks like the ones mentioned above. They can do this on a case-by-case basis, with existing processes, removing the need to adopt a new system or completely overhaul the way things are done.

For instance, one customer recently described a process for updating their pricing sheets. Carriers and steamship lines update their rates constantly, so the customer has a team of contractors whose job is to go to each carrier site, get the new rates, and update the master spreadsheets. This process alone consumes roughly 40-60 hours per week.

AI Agents can now handle this task. We're working with them to automate it while maintaining their spreadsheet-driven business process that humans can jump into any time. This is one of the beautiful things about agents: they can work side-by-side with humans, even responding to them in real time.

Our solution isn't in development yet; we are still in the problem-definition phase of our AI SDLC. But we have a clear business case, a plan, and it is entirely feasible. We'll continue through the process: assessing and mitigating risks, building evaluations, creating an MVP, setting up monitoring, and iterating. In the end, I expect us to have a system that honors their business process while automating 90% of the work.

## Considering the Human Impact
There are also human impacts to consider. I'm not so callous as to ignore that people's jobs are being impacted in all the cases I've heard about. We treat these human impacts as a critical part of our assessments with clients, not as some compliance-theater checkbox.

This isn't easy to do, just like risk assessment, but it is essential to do it consistently. Agents are reaching maturity and will soon be able to automate a significant portion of repetitive computer work. This makes it crucial to have a system for assessing, mitigating, and monitoring these effects before diving in and just "doing it with AI."

## Logistics is Changing
Hot take: the work of logistics professionals is about to fundamentally change. Many of them spend their days calling carriers, searching websites, and updating spreadsheets. These are tasks that can now be automated with increasing capability by AI Agents.

This is going to have a profound impact, and not just on logistics. But logistics is unique in that it has always been an eager early adopter of technology. AI is being adopted at scale within this industry, and the operators I talk to, even those who can barely spell AI, are chomping at the bit to remove the mindless, repetitive point-and-click tasks from their daily routines.
