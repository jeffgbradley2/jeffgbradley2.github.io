A couple of weeks ago, one of our customers came to town to discuss opportunities for improving their processes with AI. They arrived with a large team, a list of processes, and spreadsheets to back them up. We met for two days, but most of that time was taken up by executives and product people; only a few hours were spent diving into their actual workflows.

Still, they wanted our help, and I jumped on the opportunity by kicking off our AI SDLC. We had already expressed the importance of our process for evaluating use cases, impacts, and risks. As business professionals, they appreciated that kind of structure. They had concerns about AI risks and were vocally pleased that we consider and plan for them.

On Monday, I flew with my boss, the CTO, to visit them on-site. I had already created initial drafts of our Use Case Evaluation documents (written in Markdown and managed with our docs-as-code approach) and shared them with their team before we left.

We had a 90-minute session planned for the first day, but it went so well that we ended up spending much more time together, both on and off the clock. That momentum carried over into a two-hour-plus session the next day.

For me, working directly with operators is like touching grass. In IT departments and tech companies, we get so caught up in "tech stuff." It's a breath of fresh air to be in direct contact with the people doing the work, the ones with the real objectives and problems. They have problems, and engineers solve them.

At least, that’s how it has been. Things are changing. According to some, the engineer will no longer be required, or at least as required, as business users can increasingly give natural language specifications to agents to build whatever system they want.

In my experience, the reality isn't in line with that forecast at all. I know many expert business operators who are masters at their craft and dedicated to doing great work. The truth is, most of them don't like AI, don't use it, and when they do, they certainly aren't building complex systems with it.

I find the idea that operators won't need human engineers a little depressing. It's not that I think it will be fully realized, but that other engineers seem to be pushing for this. It isn't just the "work yourself out of a job, idiot" aspect; it's about how good it feels when capable operators and talented engineers get in a room and get shit done: solving complex problems and building things together that accomplish real objectives.

I'm going to be more than a little disappointed in our profession if we engineer ourselves out of that magical partnership.

It isn't up to me, though. I just work here, like all the other engineers and operators. But I do hold out hope that there will always be a place for human engineers and operators working together, even in a post-AI world.
