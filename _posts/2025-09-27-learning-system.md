We all know that as we age, we can't learn things as easily as we did when we were young. It becomes harder to quickly add to our working knowledge, and things don't stick like they did in our twenties.

This is a problem for any of us who operate in rapidly changing domains, or for those of us who change domains entirely.

However, the truth is that we still have a significant capacity to learn new things as we get older. This is undeniable. We just have to approach the process of learning in a more systematic and disciplined manner.

## Reading Isn't Retaining

As a book lover, my first instinct is to sit down with a new technical book and consume it all. I love it.

But that is not an effective way for me to learn the material. The unfortunate truth is that, even if I read actively, I'll forget most of it within a few months if I'm not using or thinking about it.

That weakness is not exclusive to those of us past our twenties, but it does hit us harder.

To combat this, active reading is critical. To do that, I survey the material with an index card, noting anything interesting, then take notes as I read. The notes will be used later in my process, and are great for review. 

Reading has its place in learning, but it is not enough on its own. 

## Exercise Your Knowledge

Our memories need to be exercised just like our muscles. If we want to learn something, we have to test ourselves.

I like to do this after reading, either the same day or the next. These days, I use LLMs to generate quizzes and exercises. Some days, that is all I do.

For example, I like to create study guides from my notes or using a tool like NotebookLM, and have an LLM create a quiz from it. If the topic can be exercises, as is normally the case, I'll have the LLM create exercises of increasing difficulty, and once complete, I'll generate markdown notes of everything covered for further review.

## Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is critical for learning new things. As mentioned, simply reading something once may be enjoyable, but without exercise and review, it will be forgotten.

This method involves spacing out your reviews, increasing the time between sessions for a particular topic as your mastery grows.

Tools like Anki do this automatically by scheduling topics for review based on your performance. If a topic is giving you trouble, it is scheduled for more frequent review. As you get more accurate, the reviews become less frequent.

## My System

I take a full immersion approach to learning. Admittedly, it is a little intense, but that is a result of my career.

I spend two hours every morning "working out" my mind. I usually spend a little time reading actively, then move on to exercises. Some mornings, all I do is exercises.

In the evenings, I continue by applying what I am learning to my side projects, if applicable.

Every day, I take notes on what I have studied and review them once a week. During that weekly review, I use LLMs to quiz me and create exercises. Anything that I struggle with goes into a "re-review" bucket for the next week. Once a month, I review everything from the entire month.

## Learning to Learn

My system is the result of many years of trial and error. It probably is not right for everyone, and not everyone can dedicate four or more hours to study and application every day. But it is important to quiz yourself, do exercises, and review material with spaced repetition. Learning how to do that is learning how to learn. Given how precious our time is, it's important to get that right.
