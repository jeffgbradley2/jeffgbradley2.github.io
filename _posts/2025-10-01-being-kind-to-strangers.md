There's a guy who bartends at a local Kava bar. He works a day job at BMW and bartends some nights as a second job. Seems like a nice guy, but reserved.

Tonight, he was at the bar, not working, when I pulled up and ordered a Kava. The bartender that night (a cool chick) asked me how I was, and I replied with "Don't feel great. Kind of dark times. A little down honestly."

The guy (I won't say any names) perked up and looked at me. He looked sad. He said he'd been down too. 

His identity had been stolen a while back (I vaguely remember him saying something one night when he was working the bar) and his credit was hammered. Shortly thereafter, his wife cheated on him and left him. She'd run up his credit cards and left him with the house payment. He had more bills than he could pay and had just gone negative. 

Other things had gone wrong, and his day job is punishing. I know he is telling the truth as he's laying this all out. 

It was a touching moment and I felt for the man. Life can be brutal. I told him that and he just nodded. 

I think that when people like this cross our paths, we are presented with a powerful opportunity. There are few things in life that are so powerful as doing a kindness to a stranger in need.

I did a small thing for him, told him to keep it between us and never mention it again. He refused at first, then appreciation washed over his face and he said it was the first time anyone had done anything like that. 

It's a curious characteristic of benevolence that we feel more love towards those who are in need. It feels good to help, even if the help is small. And helping, even in small ways, can completely change the day or even life of someone who needs that in their moment. 

It's a win-win. Might as well be kind.
