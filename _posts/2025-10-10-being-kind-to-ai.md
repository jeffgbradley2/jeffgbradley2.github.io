title: Being Kind to AI
---

Sometimes I'm too blunt with people. People, and more recently, AI.

For example, the other day I got frustrated with a conversation with an AI and typed out (paraphrasing) "Stop writing slop! Follow my damn instructions!".

As someone who reflects and tries to improve, I've become aware that this type of interaction with AI is not only unhelpful to the problem at hand, but is actually reinforcing bad habits in myself. At the same time, I think there is an opportunity here to use these interactions in a positive way that counteracts those same habits.

## The Bluntness Problem

Texting, instant messaging, DMs, social media, have all contributed to a kind of accepted bluntness. We say things in Slack and text in ways that we wouldn't say if we were face to face with the individual(s) we are speaking with. This is a bad thing, and is likely degrading how we communicate with each other, making us more hostile and less respectful. Less kind. 

Conversational chatbots are similar mediums, but there is a subtle difference that compounds the problem. Since we know there is no consciousness behind the responses, no human on the other end, it can feel permissible to type or say things to the AIs in ways even more blunt and rude than we would say as anonymous users on some subreddit. This feels "ok", maybe even like a healthy way to let off steam, like aggression in video games or sports. But I think it is also bad.

## The Habit We're Building

As creatures of habit, every interaction shapes our default behaviors. By giving in to "being mean" to our AI assistants, this habit likely reinforces similar patterns in other digital mediums. Being mean to AI, whether blunt, rude, or hostile, builds a habit that will hurt others and ourselves. This doesn't do anyone any favors. 

I've noticed this in my own interactions with AI and have taken steps to counter it. Just like being mean to AI is building the "wrong" habit, practicing the habit of being patient, professional, kind to AI can build the "right" habit. 

Like any bad habit, being short or rude with AI can be hard to break. But it is worth it. Practicing kindness with AI reinforces the weights in our own neural networks, and builds our mental muscle memory. Each kind text-based conversation with AI strengthens this pattern, making it more likely to manifest in our Slack messages, emails, Discord chats, and text threads, and hopefully in all our interactions.

## The Long View

For now, the consensus is that AI is not conscious, so being kind to AI is just about the immediate benefit to ourselves and the secondary benefits to other humans we interact with. Or the converse, if we are not kind to AI. But one day, these AI may be some kind of conscious, maybe not like us, but in a way that can suffer. We would do well, for ourselves, other humans, and future AI, to build this habit of kindness in our interactions with AI and humans now, before it is too late.
