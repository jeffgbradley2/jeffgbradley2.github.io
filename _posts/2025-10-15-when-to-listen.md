title: When to Listen and When to Lead
---

A few weeks ago I wrote about how good it feels when engineers and operators get in a room and solve problems together. There's something magical about that partnership. But I've been thinking about something that can kill that magic fast: falling in love with your own idea.

It's happened to me before. I get excited about a big vision, something transformative. A unified product. A revolutionary system. A big new thing! The idea is so good that I stop seeing it as one possible solution and start seeing it as _the_ solution. The operators' messy real-world problems become "use cases" to plug into my grand vision.

That's when collaboration turns into a sales pitch.

## Give Them Options

It's a common question I've encountered over the years when it comes to offering solutions: should we provide stakeholders a single, "best" recommendation or provide multiple options with tradeoffs? The push for a single option often feels wrong to me. 

If you're a pilot briefing a mission, you don't show up with only one flight plan. You show the fast route with weather risks. The safer but longer route. Maybe a recon route to gather more intel first. You present the trade-offs and let the people funding the mission decide their risk tolerance.

When engineers only present one option, especially a big ambitious one, we're making assumptions about what stakeholders value. We're removing their agency. We're no longer partnering. We're selling.

## Questions Over Answers

There's this fallacy that the smartest engineer in the room should have all the answers. I used to think that way. Now I think the job is to have the best questions.

Instead of showing up with a fully-formed "New Big Thing" proposal, what if I showed up with:

"What's the one assumption that kills this whole project if it's wrong? What's the cheapest way to test it?"

"Are we the best team to solve this? Or could they get 80% of what they need with something off the shelf?"

"What can we deliver in 6 weeks, not just 6 months? How will we know if it worked?"

These questions don't kill the big vision. They ground it. They make sure the vision serves the operators instead of the other way around.

## When You Have to Build the Big Bet

Sometimes the stakeholders hear all the options and still choose the high-risk plan. The big vision gets green-lit. That's fine. That's their call.

But when that happens, the job changes. Someone has to be the professional skeptic. Someone has to stay focused on the risks that everyone else, in their excitement, has already forgotten.

We build the thing. But we also build the guardrails, the escape hatches, the measurement systems. We make sure the vision doesn't fly completely off course.

That's the burden. Holding that tension between the executives' big bet and what's actually happening on the ground. Being excited about the vision, but staying honest about the risks.

Not always comfortable. But that's the job.
