"We just want it done." 

I hear this from stakeholders all the time. And I get it. With everyone racing to deploy AI, every day of planning feels like a waste, like falling behind. But I've learned that the teams who slow down first are the ones who end up shipping faster in the end.

This isn't just my own intuition either. I've been reading [Machine Learning System Design](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-system-design) by Valerii Babushkin and Arseny Kravchenko, and they make this point: junior engineers jump right into solutions (what I call "solutioning"), while senior engineers focus on understanding and defining the problem first, then move to formal design specifications.

## Our Phase 1 Process

In working toward ISO 42001 certification at my day job, I implemented an AI Software Development Lifecycle that consists of phases, the first of which is the Problem Definition Phase. That phase consists of creating a formal Problem Definition, Impact Assessment, Risk Assessment, Feasibility Study, and System Design Specification. That covers all the bases and then some that the authors recommend. 

This can take time, and it does slow down the process in the beginning. It can feel counter intuitive to spend valuable time writing documentation. But, as the authors of Machine Learning System Design (and plenty of other books) point out repeatedly and I have found to be true in practice, the time spent going slow in the beginning enables going fast in later stages of the SDLC, and avoids traps that jumping directly into coding would fall into.

## What Problem Definition Really Means

Defining the problem requires spending time with domain experts, the operators performing the process or workflow, documenting what they do and what they need. It means asking "Why" over and over, and exploring alternatives (not just providing a solution). It should also involve initial exploration of stakeholder analysis, potential risks and impacts from the perspective of those stakeholders. 

Following that Problem Definition, we perform an Impact Assessment that builds on the stakeholders and issues identified in the PD. We analyze desired impacts, potential negative impacts, and ways the system could be abused. This feeds into the Risk Assessment, which follows the NIST Risk Framework, where we evaluate likelihoods and impacts and calculate risk scores for all identified risks. We also review existing risks and controls to see what applies to the new use case. 

Finally, we create a Feasibility Study that documents if we can do this, and provides options for moving forward. This study is provided, along with the impact and risk assessments, to the stakeholders and leadership, who make a Go/No Go Decision. If the decision is Go, we move on to working on a System Design Specification.

All of this is done in Markdown and stored in Gitlab according to our docs-as-code approach, which enables us to take advantage of automation and scripting in our CI/CD pipelines and supports enterprise-grade document control.

## Going Slow is Good for the Customer

Recently, a customer approached us with processes to automate. Their operations team was drowning in manual data processing, spreadsheets, emails. They wanted an AI solution "yesterday." They just wanted "AI to do it" and expected it to happen fast.

But we forced ourselves through Phase 1. During problem definition sessions with the actual operators, we discovered critical aspects of their use cases and their desired end states, we clearly defined who the key stakeholders were that were impacted, and assessed risks that no one had thought about. In the end, even though they wanted us to go fast, we presented our findings and they were very responsive. 

## The Discipline to Go Slow

Even with the automation, however, it can still seem like we are "going slow", especially to certain stakeholders that "just want it done." However, after spending this time upfront clearly defining the problem, impacts, risks, and feasibility, we are in a much better place to make an informed decision and move forward quickly, confident that we are not walking into a disaster. We aren't guessing, but have a clear plan for moving forward responsibly.

It is this "slow" phase 1 process that enables us to go fast. In an industry obsessed with speed, where everyone just wants AI deployed now, the most durable competitive advantage is discipline, not velocity. The discipline to define the problem correctly before writing a single line of code. 

That's what separates responsible teams from those that ship broken systems that don't meet the needs of the stakeholders.
