title: Internal Audits Made Easy
---

Audits are part of compliance. It's simply a fact of organizational life.

With ISO standards (9001, 42001, etc.), the organization is required to perform at least one "internal audit", which is an audit the organization performs on itself. This is in addition to the annual "registration audit", which is performed by an authorized body that can grant certification.

Having recently implemented an AI Management System (AIMS) to the ISO 42001 standard and preparing for the registration audit, it was time for me to perform the internal audit of our AIMS. I did that this week.

## Components of an ISO Audit

An ISO audit consists of a few key components and activities.

First is the audit plan. ISO audits require a plan that details what, when, and where the audit will be performed, and who will be performing it. It includes the audit scope, the dates and times, any specific individuals that need to be interviewed, and a schedule of when each component will be audited.

The plan is presented in the opening meeting, which requires an agenda. I typically create the opening meeting agenda after the plan has been completed, then schedule the meeting with key stakeholders. In the meeting, the lead auditor (me in this case) walks stakeholders through the plan and what to expect.

Before each audit, I create an audit checklist. This is something I learned years ago in auditor training at Greenville Technical College, and it is a great tool for an audit. Checklists are great in general, but an audit checklist makes audits much more manageable and repeatable. I create a checklist covering every requirement in the ISO standard being audited, with space to check off for each item, and sections for documenting evidence, notes, and findings. 

As the audit progresses, the lead auditor will look for evidence for each item in the checklist, interview employees, and dig up records. This can be done remotely for a digital system like our AI Management System.

After the audit, the lead auditor (me again) compiles everything from the checklist into a final audit report that summarizes what was audited, the findings, and any nonconformances. This report is presented to the stakeholders in the closing meeting. And yes, an agenda is required for that meeting.

## Advantages of Docs-as-Code

I got all that done in just two days for our new AIMS, with 6 minor nonconformances and a few observations and opportunities for improvement. Given the scale of everything I had to audit (a full system audit in preparation for the registration audit), I'm pleased it got done so quickly. 

I have AI and Docs-as-Code to thank for that.

In the past, ISO management systems I worked in or built were largely documented in Word documents and Excel spreadsheets. I wrote about how that is kind of legacy in my [Docs as Code](/2025/08/21/docs-as-code/) post, and how treating documentation like code is beneficial for a number of reasons.

But man, was it _hugely_ beneficial for the internal audit. 

Having all documentation, including policies, procedures, and all governance records (design specs, assessments, meeting minutes, etc.) proved to be a major boon to my audit. With everything in a consistent format, all stored in in the same git repo, I found the audit to fly by.

## AI-Assisted Auditing

This time around, I also leveraged Claude Code (an AI coding assistant) with custom instructions (skill) to be my audit assistant. With CC working with our docs in Markdown format, it was incredibly fast to find evidence and log detailed notes and findings. CC made it easier for me to go much deeper as well, finding things I normally wouldn't have found.

While the quality of the output of Claude Code does have to be verified (doable with a separate verifier agent in addition to my own reviews) there is no doubt that this cut the audit time in half _at least_, while also going deeper than I would have been able to go on my own. 

Using Claude Code also allowed me to sidestep the sticky issue of auditing my own work. When it came time, I just had my audit assistant "interview" me. It did a really good job of this.

## Looking Forward to the Registration Audit

As we approach the registration audit, it will be interesting to see how external auditors adapt to our docs-as-code approach with all docs in Markdown and our Gitlab Pages site. But after this internal audit, there is no going back for me. Claude Code plus docs-as-code makes audits _much_ easier.
