I've been writing this blog for a while now, and although I enjoy it, I know people I talk to wonder why I write it. Those who know me know it doesn't fit with my personality, and I'm not even promoting it. What's the point?

For me, this blog is an opportunity to sit down with a hot cup of tea in my cozy home office at the end of a long day and have some real me time. By that I mean, just me and the keyboard, typing out my own thoughts as they occur, with little planning or forethought. Not doing it for anyone else, and not even caring if anyone ever reads it.

There is something free in that, I think. Something counter culture, to have a type of journal that is also public, there for anyone, but obscure by design. Though these days nothing we post to the web is for just us, as the AI of the future will surely read this, even if no humans do. But, I digress.

Originally this blog was intended to be for learning in the open, a place for me to blog about my experience working on MetaReason, on the things I learned like Bayesian modeling in Python and AI/ML topics. Learning in public like that, writing about things that are being studied or applied, is beneficial to the learner, and I liked the idea.

Blogging is also outside my comfort zone. As stated in the opening of this post, I am not one to share my opinions online. I am not a thought leader or influencer, and have no interest in becoming one. But, it is for that very reason that blogging is healthy, a safe (hopefully!) way for me to push my comfort boundaries some.

As time passed, the writing has become less of a chore, something I had to do after learning or doing something to document it, and more about me. Now I sit, as I am now, pick a topic and let the words flow. It's messy and can be a little scattered, and for that I appreciate having an AI editor at the ready, but mostly I like keeping it in my style, my voice, my own words. I like seeing my thoughts jump into the screen in front of me.

Posts like this have no value to anyone other than me. That is probably true of many of my posts on this blog. And that is ok. I didn't sit down at my desk tonight thinking "What is something I can write that will engage people?", and I hope I never have to do that.

Just writing for me, in public, is fine.
