> Everyone faces up more bravely to a thing for which he has long prepared himself, sufferings, even, being withstood if they have been trained for in advance. Those who are unprepared, on the other hand, are panic-stricken by the most insignificant happenings.

Since the dawn of history, across thousands of years that we have record of, traditions of philosophy and military strategy, and the most rigorous thinkers who ever lived, have shared something that is as important now as it ever was: preparation is key, and the prepared mind is one that overcomes adversity and thrives.

The Stoics held preparedness as a core tenet. They actively practiced _premeditatio malorum_ — the premeditation of evils — visualizing worst-case scenarios and planning how they would overcome them, preparing their minds. Of course, they took this much farther by placing themselves directly in situations that tested their strength and built their character, doing hard things for the sake of building that strength of mind. Such character building and preparation are alien to our comfortable modern lives. Our prosperity has made it easy to avoid discomfort, and without external pressure, few of us choose to prepare for calamity.

> It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself to deal with difficult times; while fortune is bestowing favors on it then is the time for it to be strengthened against her rebuffs.

My sense of urgency around preparedness has deepened over the last few years. We live in turbulent times, with geopolitical upheaval, social unrest, and technological breakthroughs. AI alone threatens to automate huge amounts of labor, particularly in technical domains. And yet, it is easy to carry on as though nothing has changed, business as usual, even as the foundation we have built our lives on shifts beneath us.

If we do not prepare ourselves, we leave ourselves and those who depend on us open to the whims of whatever comes our way.

> He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.

But what does preparedness look like in practice? Each of our situations is different, and what one can and should do to prepare for future challenges depends on many factors. But in general, I believe we can all work to strengthen a few core areas of our lives:

- Physical
- Mental
- Emotional
- Financial

Underlying all of these is discipline. Without discipline, nothing can be accomplished, while with it, anything can be.

> The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
>
> — Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Preparing ourselves, by exercising our minds and bodies, by living minimally, by building financial reserves, can seem impossible at first. Giving up the pleasures that our wealth affords us, not buying that nice car, not going out every night, seems extreme, paranoid even. Waking up early, exercising and meditating, practicing physical and mental discomfort, and spending hours honing our skills and learning new ones seems equally extreme.

But our minds _lie_ to us. We think "I don't want to exercise every day" or "life isn't worth living if I give up pizza and beer" or "there isn't anything I can do, everything will turn out ok." And none of it is true! Within a few months of exercising, or giving up beer or pizza, the mind miraculously reverses its prior stance: "I love exercising, I will never give this up" or "I don't need pizza and beer, I'm happier without it." It is amazing.

> Nothing gives one keener pleasure than the ability to derive pleasure even from that, and the feeling of having arrived at something which one cannot be deprived of by any unjust stroke of fortune.
>
> — Seneca

Some say that you can't prepare, that we don't know what the future holds. What can we do? It will be what it will be, they say. It will all be alright, don't worry.

It is true that the world is chaos incarnate, and plans burn in the fires of that chaos. But that does not mean we cannot prepare _ourselves_ and take actions here and now which will make us better equipped for the chaos that will inevitably befall us. There is a reason that the militaries of the world plan and prepare religiously. War is chaos, and while that chaos supersedes the plans made, preparation is the only thing that can withstand it. It works.

> We cannot be readily ruined by a single error, if we have made reasonable preparations.

> — Carl von Clausewitz, On War

As we enter increasingly turbulent and uncertain times, with AI threatening to automate much of what many of us do, we can work on ourselves, strengthen our bodies and minds. We can hone our skills and build new ones, stack our skills, and become generalists. As David Epstein pointed out in his great book _Range_, generalists outperform specialists. Stacking skills by combining abilities across domains rather than going deep in just one makes us harder to replace and more adaptable when the landscape shifts. But it takes effort to build our skills and abilities without being forced to by an employer. It takes discipline to prepare.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems.

We modern humans, in our advanced societies, have just as much imperative to prepare as our ancestors. What we see befalling those less fortunate throughout the world and in history can befall us. We can and should prepare, and build the strength of character to weather hardship and turn challenges into accomplishments, adversity into success.

The time to prepare is always before the storm, and the storm is here. Prepare.
